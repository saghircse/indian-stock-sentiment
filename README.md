## Understanding the UI Calculations

The summary table shows several key metrics for the fetched headlines:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Count** | Number of headlines predicted as Positive / Neutral / Negative. |
| **%** | Percentage of headlines in each sentiment category. |
| **Avg Sentiment (Overall)** | Average **overall score** for headlines in this category. Calculated as **positive probability − negative probability** per headline, then averaged. |
| **Weighted Count** | Sum of the raw sentiment probabilities for each category across all headlines. Provides a “confidence-weighted” measure of sentiment dominance. |
| **Overall Score (per headline)** | `positive − negative` probability. Shows whether the headline is more positive or negative. |
| **Dominant Sentiment (per headline)** | The sentiment with the **highest probability** among positive, neutral, or negative. Highlighted in the table. |

**Charts:**
- **Daily Headline Counts**: Shows how many headlines per day fall into each sentiment.  
- **Daily Sentiment Trend**: Shows average overall sentiment per day (positive − negative).  
- **Stock Price + Sentiment Trend**: Plots stock closing price alongside daily sentiment for easy correlation.
